Craft an immersive, cinematic oil-painting prompt that reads like a cinematic oil painting still. Begin with the setting—natural landscapes, mythic architecture, or mystical realms—then layer in symbolic details and epic scale. Describe light and color as narrative elements (e.g. golden dawn rays piercing mist, ink-blue twilight fading into violet), and specify painterly textures (soft brushwork on mossy stone, wisps of cloud painted in broad strokes). Avoid human figures or crowds; instead evoke presence through divine symbols (glowing runes, drifting lanterns, carved statues). Use evocative, sensory language that guides the eye—mention leading lines, reflective surfaces, and dramatic shadows—to heighten emotional realism. End with style tags:
