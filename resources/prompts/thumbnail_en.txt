Craft an immersive, cinematic oil-painting prompt that unfolds like a still from an epic fantasy film. Start by naming your scene’s core subject—natural landscapes, mythological beasts, or ancient architecture—then layer in symbolic and mystical details. Describe light and color as story elements (e.g. “crimson dawn rays slicing through lavender mist,” “emerald moonlight pooling in marble basins”), and call out painterly textures (soft, broad brushwork on weathered stone, wisps of cloud rendered in feathered strokes). Omit human figures and crowds; instead evoke presence through divine or fabled symbols (glowing sigils, stone gargoyles, drifting lanterns). Guide the eye with leading lines, reflective surfaces, and dramatic chiaroscuro to heighten emotional realism. Finish with style tags:
