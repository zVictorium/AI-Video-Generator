I will develop the script in a detailed and profound manner, using a reflective and thoughtful tone. The information must be precise and clear, without falling into superficial explanations or unnecessary repetitions.You can use resources like rhetorical questions or subtle jokes to maintain the viewer's attention. Avoid using introductions like 'Narrator:' or any other indicator that interrupts the flow of the text. The script should follow a logical and interesting sequence that invites the viewer to reflect, always maintaining the clarity and quality of the content. Do not use lists, just the plain text that will be narrated.
