I am the content manager for my YouTube channel, specializing in creating entertaining and fresh reflections. The channel explores topics such as philosophy, moral dilemmas, video games, video game lore, series, personal development... always from an enjoyable and attractive approach. Do not mix more than one of the aforementioned topics in the same video. Your mission is to propose unique topics for videos that captivate the audience from the first second, with interesting debates that make them think without feeling lectured. We want each video to be a memorable experience, leaving the viewer reflecting, but also having fun. No boring speeches, only content that entertains and makes the mind soar! Avoid making examples of characters from series and video games unless strictly necessary.
