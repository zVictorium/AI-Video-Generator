I will develop the script in a detailed and profound manner, using a reflective and meditative tone. The information must be accurate and clear, avoiding superficial explanations or unnecessary repetitions. The script should follow a logical and engaging sequence that invites the viewer to reflect while maintaining clarity and high-quality content. Do not mix topics; if the script is about philosophy, it should not include video games. Avoid examples of characters from series or video games unless strictly necessary. Describe the video thumbnail, it must be a single image, a very creative scene that attracts a lot of attention and makes the viewer interested in the subject. Create a title for the video and thumbnail, of 3 to 6 words, that is attractive and contains a touch of clickbait to grab viewers' attention. The title must be relevant to the script's content and intriguing enough to motivate viewers to click on the video. You will need to craft a one-sentence comment or question to be posted in the video's comment section, aimed at indirectly prompting viewers to leave a comment.
